# **Procedure (Easy and Slightly Detailed Version)**

### **Step 1: Select a Company**

First, choose a company that regularly sends newsletters. It should be a well-known brand so you can easily receive their emails.
For this experiment, **Flipkart** is selected because it often sends emails about sales, new products, and offers.

### **Step 2: Subscribe to the Newsletter**

Go to the Flipkart website. Log in or create a new account if needed.
Make sure the option for receiving promotional emails is turned ON in your account settings.
This allows Flipkart to send newsletters to your email.
To stay organized, create a separate folder in your email inbox to store all Flipkart newsletters.

### **Step 3: Collect the Newsletters**

After subscribing, wait for 2–4 newsletters to arrive.
Save each newsletter as a screenshot or PDF and note the date you received it.
Example:

* July 1 – “Monsoon Sale”
* July 10 – “Back to School Deals”
* July 17 – “Mega Electronics Days”

This helps you compare how the content changes from one email to another.

### **Step 4: Analyze the Content**

Carefully read what is written in each newsletter.
Check the type of information they share—discounts, new arrivals, sales, or tips.
Notice the tone of the message (friendly, persuasive, or formal).
Look for personalized details like your name or product recommendations.
Also look for **calls-to-action (CTAs)** like *“Buy Now,” “Explore More,” “Shop Today.”*

### **Step 5: Analyze the Structure and Layout**

Now focus on how the newsletter looks visually. Observe:

* Where the Flipkart logo is placed
* The use of Flipkart’s blue and yellow colors
* Images of products
* Font size and readability
* Buttons for shopping
* Whether it looks good on both phone and laptop

Flipkart usually uses a clean layout with big product images and easy-to-read text.

### **Step 6: Evaluate Branding**

Check how Flipkart shows its brand identity.
Branding includes logo, color theme, style of writing, and taglines.
Flipkart maintains the same colors, friendly tone, and slogan-like messages.
This helps readers recognize the brand immediately and builds trust.

### **Step 7: Identify the Target Audience**

Try to understand who the newsletter is mainly for.
Some emails target students, some target tech lovers, and some target home shoppers.
You can identify this by looking at the products shown, the titles used, and special sections like “Top Picks for You” or “Student Offers.”

### **Step 8: Write the Report and Conclusion**

Finally, write your findings in a simple report.
Include:

* How the newsletter looks
* What type of content it has
* How Flipkart uses branding
* Who the newsletter is meant for

End with a conclusion explaining how Flipkart’s newsletters help in marketing, increase customer interest, and improve engagement.
