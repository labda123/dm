# **Simplified Procedure (Easy English)**

### **Step 1: Collect Data**

* Political teams gather data from:

  * Social media (likes, shares, follows)
  * Surveys and public profiles
  * Third-party data providers

---

### **Step 2: Audience Segmentation**

* Group users using tools like **Facebook Audience Manager**:

  * By age, location, education, or political interest
  * By topics of interest (jobs, environment, nationalism)
* Each group will get a **custom message**.

---

### **Step 3: Create and Test Messages**

* Make different versions of the ad:

  * Ad 1: “We’ll create 10 million jobs”
  * Ad 2: “Our opponent failed to create jobs”
* Use **A/B testing** to see which ad works better.

---

### **Step 4: Deliver Ads**

* Post ads on:

  * Facebook / Meta Ads Manager
  * Twitter Ads
  * Google Ads / YouTube
* Set the **budget** and **schedule** to show ads at the best times.

---

### **Step 5: Monitor Campaign**

* Check performance:

  * Reach (number of people seeing the ad)
  * Click-through rate (CTR)
  * Conversions (signup, vote pledge)
* Adjust the ads if performance drops.

---

### **Step 6: Ethical Review**

* Platforms may require:

  * “Paid for by” labels on political ads
  * Some restrictions on fake news
* Enforcement may not be perfect, so campaigns need careful monitoring.
